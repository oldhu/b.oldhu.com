<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1427" class="bvMsg"><p>I downloaded and installed Snow Leopard A380(WWDC version). It feels a little bit faster than Leopard. But lack of some features I wanted:</p>
<p>1. Exchange support. It may support Exchange 2007 only. I cannot get my corp's Exchange server 2003 setup.</p>
<p>2. Dock Expose. Demoed at WWDC, but not included in the version distributed in WWDC?</p>
<p>3. Cisco VPN. The new cisco VPN network connection cannot work. I have to use cisco's own vpn client again.</p>
