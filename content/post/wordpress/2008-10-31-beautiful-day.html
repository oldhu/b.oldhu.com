<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1257" class="bvMsg"><p>by U2</p> <p>One of my favorites. Suggest every reader listen to it at least 5 times. It will sing inside your brain.</p> <p> <div style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;"><div>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omFdpnSu57U&amp;hl=en]</div></div></p> <p>Lyrics:</p> <p>The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground <br />There's no room, no space to rent in this town</p> <p>You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care <br />The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere <p>You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place <br />Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace <p>It's a beautiful day !<br />Sky falls, you feel like <br />It's a beautiful day !<br />Don't let it get away <p>You're on the road, but you've got no destination <br />You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination <p>You love this town even if that doesn't ring true <br />You've been all over and it's been all over you <p>It's a beautiful day <br />Don't let it get away <br />It's a beautiful day</p> <p>Touch me, take me to that other place <br />Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case</p> <p>See the world in green and blue <br />See China right in front of you <br />See the canyons broken by cloud <br />See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out <br />See the Bedouin fires at night <br />See the oil fields at first light <br />And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth <br />After the flood all the colors came out <p>What you don't have you don't need it now <br />What you don't know you can feel it somehow <br />What you don't have you don't need it now <br />Don't need it now <br />Was a beautiful day </div>
