<p>Although Moleskine srl claims their notebook has been used by well-known artists and writers, such as <strong>Picasso, Matisse, Kurakin and Hemingway</strong>, the brand Moleskine was officially registered only in <strong>1996</strong>. Francesco Franceschi, head of Modo &amp; Modo's marketing department, was quoted as saying, "It's an exaggeration. It's marketing, not science. <strong>It's not the absolute truth</strong>."</p>
