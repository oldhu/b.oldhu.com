I'm going to Shenyang tomorrow to support an IPTV project. The manager told me "I'm looking forward to the result."

How can I manage the result? I'm not the sales man, not the pre sales people, I even do not know when I can meet Mr. customer again.

Dear Mr. manager, I'm looking forward to the result too.
