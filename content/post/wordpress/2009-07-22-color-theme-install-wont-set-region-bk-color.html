title: color-theme-install won't set region background color

<p>I'm running emacs 23 cvs binary on Snow Leopard. I found that the background color of my selection region won't follow settings of my color-theme, the following line in color-theme-install doesn't work as designed:</p>
<pre>(region ((t (:background "#2e3436"))))</pre>
<p>To work around this, you need to set the color of region background manually:</p>
<pre>
(require 'color-theme)
(require 'color-theme-subdued)
(eval-after-load "color-theme"
  '(progn
     (color-theme-initialize)
     (color-theme-subdued)))

(set-face-background 'region "#2e3436")
</pre>
