title: Updated Micolog-oldhu to Support More Desktop Blog Client

<p>I was trying to adopt a new desktop blog client rather than Textmate. I found different blog client handles iso date format differently.</p><p>Some of them add a ‘Z’ and the end of date, some of them not.</p><p>Micolog’s RPC API supports both situations now.</p>
