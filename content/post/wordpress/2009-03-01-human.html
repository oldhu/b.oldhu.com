<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1385" class="bvMsg"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d97XFGR_IP0&amp;feature=related"> Youtube Link</a><br /><br />I did my best to notice<br />
When the call came down the line<br />
Up to the platform of surrender<br />
I was brought but I was kind<br />
<br />
And sometimes I get nervous<br />
When I see an open door<br />
Close your eyes, clear your heart<br />
Cut the cord<br />
<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
My sign is vital, my hands are cold<br />
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
<br />
Pay my respects to grace and virtue<br />
Send my condolences to good<br />
Give my regards to soul and romance<br />
They always did the best they could<br />
<br />
And so long to devotion<br />
You taught me everything I know<br />
Wave goodbye, wish me well<br />
You've gotta let me go<br />
<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
My sign is vital, my hands are cold<br />
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
<br />
Will your system be alright<br />
When you dream of home tonight?<br />
There is no message we're receiving<br />
Let me know, is your heart still beating?<br />
<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
My sign is vital, my hands are cold<br />
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer<br />
<br />
You've gotta let me know<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
My sign is vital, my hands are cold<br />
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?<br />
Are we human or are we dancers?
