<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1029" class="bvMsg">Some interesting facts about slash and path name in Mac OS X:<br /><ol><li>    In Finder, you can create/rename a folder with slash in it's name.</li><li>    Internally, it stores slash as colon.</li><li>    So you can see slash is actually a colon in Terminal</li><li>    But, you cannot create a folder with colon in it's name in Finder</li></ol><br />So, when it comes to script/programming, it's more tricky. I was scripting with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/scripting/">JavaScript/InDesign</a>, the facts about this combination are:<br /><ol><li>    Read a path name with slash(which is slash in Finder, and colon in Terminal) in it, you get a string with colon</li><li>    To create a folder with slash and colon in it's path, Folder.create method will fail</li><li>    Folder.create method just does not allow colon in it's path.</li><li>    Finally I cannot figure out how to create a folder with slash(which is colon actually) in it's name.</li></ol></div>
