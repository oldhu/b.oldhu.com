<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1407" class="bvMsg"><p>I'm not going to ask questions about meanings of life/work/blahblah... I'm going to quote some lines from Boston Legal.</p>
<p>&gt; Denny Crane: Edwin Poole's problem is he doesn't like being Edwin Poole(Edwin is a named partner and a psycho). From time to time he'd look in the mirror and ask, &quot;What's the point?&quot; I never do that. Questions like that'll kill you.</p>
<p>&gt; Alan Shore: Questions like, &quot;What's the point?&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; Denny Crane: ...... <strong>What's the point? You don't ask -- that's the point.</strong> You gonna win, by the way? The world wants to know.<br /></p>
