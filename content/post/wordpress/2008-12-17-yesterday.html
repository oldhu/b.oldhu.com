<div id="msgcns!A65130FDDC997385!1342" class="bvMsg"><p>by Beatles <p>Yesterday, <br />All my troubles seemed so far away, <br />Now it looks as though they're here to stay, <br />Oh, I believe in yesterday.  <p><br />Suddenly, <br />I'm not half the man I used to be, <br />There's a shadow hanging over me, <br />Oh, yesterday came suddenly. <p>……  </div>
